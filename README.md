# Secure Express.js Application

This is a simple Express.js application that serves a static `index.html` file over HTTPS using a self-signed certificate generated with `mkcert`.

## Features

- HTTPS support with a self-signed certificate
- Serves static files from a `public` directory
- Example `index.html` file to test the server

## Prerequisites

1. **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed. [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
2. **mkcert**: Install mkcert to generate a self-signed certificate. [mkcert Documentation](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert).

## Project Structure

```
ias-sba/
├── cert/                  # SSL certificates directory
│   ├── localhost-key.pem  # Private key for HTTPS
│   ├── localhost.pem      # Certificate file for HTTPS
├── public/                # Directory for static files
│   └── index.html         # Static HTML file
├── server.js              # Main server script
├── package.json           # npm configuration file
└── package-lock.json      # Auto-generated by npm
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Setting Up HTTPS

1. Navigate to the `cert` directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir cert
   cd cert
   ```
2. Generate a self-signed certificate for `localhost` using `mkcert`:
   ```bash
   mkcert -install
   mkcert -key-file localhost-key.pem -cert-file localhost.pem localhost
   ```
3. Ensure the certificate files (`localhost-key.pem` and `localhost.pem`) are in the `cert` directory.

## Running the Server

1. Start the server:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```
2. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   https://localhost:3000
   ```

## Dependencies
